Hive Helsinki project.
___
### Introduction
Hive Helsinki and other 42 schools forbid the use of most C standard library functions, so the first real task is to create your very own library containing functions you can use in future projects. In addition to mandatory functions required for project completion, I have added more useful functions and merged whole printf project into this library. The functions are logically divided into subdirectories and every directory has its own header file.
